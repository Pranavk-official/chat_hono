- **Can do**:
  - Edit group information (name, description, privacy)
  - Delete the entire group
  - Promote/demote any member to any role
  - Remove any member (except themselves)
  - Transfer ownership to another member
- **Visual indicator**: Crown icon (👑) in group list and "Owner" badge

### **⭐ ADMIN**
- **Permissions**: Administrative privileges with limitations
- **Can do**:
  - Edit group information (name, description, privacy)
  - Promote members to Admin role
  - Demote regular members
  - Remove regular members
  - Add new members
- **Cannot do**:
  - Remove or demote the Owner

  - View group information
  - Leave the group (remove themselves)
- **Cannot do**:

## 🚀 **New API Endpoints**

### **Update Member Role**
```http
PUT /api/groups/:groupId/members/:userId/role
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "role": "ADMIN" | "MEMBER" | "OWNER"
}
```

**Permission Requirements**:
- Only `OWNER` and `ADMIN` can change roles
- `ADMIN` can only promote `MEMBER` to `ADMIN` or demote `ADMIN` to `MEMBER`
- Only `OWNER` can promote someone to `OWNER` (transfers ownership)
- Cannot change the current owner's role unless self-transfer

## 🎨 **UI Enhancements**

### **Member List Interface**
- **Role Badges**: Color-coded role indicators
  - `OWNER`: Gold background (#ffd700)
  - `ADMIN`: Blue background (#e3f2fd) 
  - `MEMBER`: Purple background (#f3e5f5)

- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive based on permissions
  - `↑ Admin`: Promote member to admin
  - `👑 Owner`: Transfer ownership (owners only)
  - `↓ Member`: Demote admin to member
  - `Remove`: Remove member from group

### **Group List Indicators**
- **👑**: Shows next to group name if you're the owner
- **⭐**: Shows next to group name if you're an admin
- **Role in Header**: Chat header shows your role in parentheses

### **Smart Permission UI**
- Buttons only appear if you have permission to perform the action
- Disabled fields for users without edit permissions
- Contextual help text explaining permission requirements

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Permission Logic**
```typescript
const canUpdateRole = 
  updaterMember.role === GroupMemberRole.OWNER ||
  (updaterMember.role === GroupMemberRole.ADMIN && 
   memberToUpdate.role === GroupMemberRole.MEMBER);
```

### **Frontend Role Checks**
```javascript
const canManageRoles = currentUserRole === 'OWNER' || currentUserRole === 'ADMIN';
const canRemove = !isCurrentUser && (
  currentUserRole === 'OWNER' ||
  (currentUserRole === 'ADMIN' && member.role === 'MEMBER')
);
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Promoting a Member to Admin**
1. Open group members modal
2. Find the member you want to promote
3. Click "↑ Admin" button
4. Confirm the action
5. Member role updates instantly

### **Transferring Ownership**
1. Only owners see the "👑 Owner" button
2. Click to transfer ownership to another member
3. Confirm with special warning dialog
4. Current owner becomes admin, target becomes owner
5. Group list updates to reflect new role

### **Role-Based Group Management**
- **Group Info**: Shows role statistics and your current role
- **Edit Permissions**: Only owners/admins can edit group settings
- **Delete Group**: Only owners can delete groups
- **Smart Filtering**: Search results exclude existing members

## 🚨 **Safety Features**

### **Confirmation Dialogs**
- **Ownership Transfer**: Special warning about role change
- **Role Changes**: Clear confirmation with user name and new role
- **Member Removal**: Standard confirmation dialog

### **Error Handling**
- **Permission Denied**: Clear error messages
- **Invalid Operations**: Prevented at UI level
- **Network Errors**: Graceful degradation with retry options

### **Business Rules**
- Cannot remove yourself as owner (must transfer first)
- Cannot have multiple owners (automatic demotion on transfer)
- Cannot promote to owner if not current owner
- Admins cannot demote other admins

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

All role management features work seamlessly across:
- **Desktop**: Full functionality with hover states
- **Tablet**: Touch-friendly buttons and modals
- **Mobile**: Optimized button sizes and layouts

## 🧪 **Testing the Features**

### **Setup Test Environment**
1. Create a test group
2. Add multiple users with different roles

### **Test Scenarios**
- **Owner → Admin → Member**: Test full demotion chain
- **Member → Admin → Owner**: Test full promotion chain  
- **Cross-permissions**: Verify admins cannot demote other admins
- **Self-management**: Ensure users can only remove themselves
